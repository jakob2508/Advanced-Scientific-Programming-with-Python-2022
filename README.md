# Advanced-Scientific-Programming-with-Python-2022
My project for the Advanced Scientific Programming with Python 2022 course.

In this project I aim to improve an existing code used for my doctoral studies (old_script.py).

In particular, I want to use:
- restructure the programm by splitting the programm into a data file, a class file and a main file.
- Apply object oriented programming with classes and modules
- More commenting
- Less repetition
- Test functions
- Cleaner more beautiful code!
